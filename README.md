# express-typescript-boilerplate
A boilerplate for a Node.js server with Express framework and a client app built with Webpack. Written in Typescript. Supports containerization using Docker.

## Install
`npm install`

## Develop
`npm run start:dev`

### Project structure
<dl>
    <dt>public</dt>
    <dd>Static assets like images may go here. They are served using a static middleware. Assets generated by Webpack are put into the `generated` subfolder.</dd>
    <dt>public/generated</dt>
    <dd>Assets generated by Webpack</dd>
    <dt>src</dt>
    <dd>The server application</dd>
    <dt>src/app</dt>
    <dd>The client application</dd>
</dl>

## Run in production
The `postinstall` script automatically builds the client app.
As long as `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, just run `npm install && npm start`. Else, use `npm run start:prod` instead of `npm start`.
